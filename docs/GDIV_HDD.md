## Design

The Goldschmidt division is a fast division method. This division is a iterative process governed by the following equations:

$$d(i) = d[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$
$$D(i) = D[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$ 

were $d$ is the divisor; $D$ is the dividend; $i$ is the step. $D$ converges toward the quotient and $d$ converges toward 1 at a quadratic rate. For the divisor to converge to 1 it must be less than 2 therefore integers greater than 2 must be multiplied by 10 to the negative powers to shift the decimal point.

Consider the following example: 
$\dfrac{16}{4}$

|  Step  | D                | d                 | 2-d              |

The code implementation compares the size of the divisor against 2 âˆ— 10^_n_ were _n_ is a natural number. The result of the comparison indicates the _m_ of 10^_m_, were _m_ is a negative integer, to multiply the divisor. Then the Goldschmidt division is performed until the divisor converges to degree indicated by `P GDIV ACCURACY`. The quotient returned is the rounded up value to which the dividend converged to. Each Goldschmidt step is performed in to two half steps in order use only half the multipliers and save resources. 

The remainder calculation requires an extra clock cycle. The calculation simply takes the value after the decimal point of the quotient a multiplies it by the divisor.

### Optimizations

The following describes design decisions used to optimized the design. These improve resource consumption and timing at the cost of results' precision.

#### 1's Complement vs 2's Complement

In the case of computing $2-d[i-1]$ let us consider the diference between the 2's and 1's complement. The 1's complement of a binary number is the invertion of each bit of the vector that repesents the number. On the other hand the 2's complement operation used to obtain the negative version of a number represented in binary form is the inversion of each bit followed by adding 1. Hence;

$$2 - d[i-1] \equiv 2 + ( invert(d[i-1]) + 1)$$

But as the bit resolution increases the effect less meaningful the contribution of the least significant bit in the magnitud of a binary represented number. Here is a demonstration.

|      Base      |          Binary Form          | Decimal Aproximation |
| :------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------: |
|      0.3       | 0000.0100_1100_1100_1100_1101 |     0.3000001907     |
| 2's complement | 1111.1011_0011_0011_0011_0011 |    -0.3000001907     |
| 1's complement | 1111.1011_0011_0011_0011_0010 |    -0.3000011444     |

Taking the previous into consideration we can lower the computational complexity by skipping the addition of 1 after the invertion. For our purposes this is an acceptable rounding error, specially when taking into account that the larger the vector the less significant is the error and the more the plus can cost to implement. This is the resulting approximation implemented in the design:

$$2 - d[i-1] \approxeq 2 + invert(d[i-1])$$
