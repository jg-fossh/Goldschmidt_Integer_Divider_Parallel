## Design

The Goldschmidt division is a fast division method. This division is a iterative process governed by the following equations:

$$d(i) = d[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$
$$D(i) = D[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$ 

were $d$ is the divisor; $D$ is the dividend; $i$ is the step. $D$ converges toward the quotient and $d$ converges toward 1 at a quadratic rate. For the divisor to converge to 1 it must be less than 2 therefore integers greater than 2 must be multiplied by 10 to the negative powers to shift the decimal point.

Consider the following example: 
$\dfrac{16}{4}$

|  Step  | D                | d                 | 2-d              |

The code implementation compares the size of the divisor against 2 âˆ— 10^_n_ were _n_ is a natural number. The result of the comparison indicates the _m_ of 10^_m_, were _m_ is a negative integer, to multiply the divisor. Then the Goldschmidt division is performed until the divisor converges to degree indicated by `P GDIV ACCURACY`. The quotient returned is the rounded up value to which the dividend converged to. Each Goldschmidt step is performed in to two half steps in order use only half the multipliers and save resources. 

The remainder calculation requires an extra clock cycle. The calculation simply takes the value after the decimal point of the quotient a multiplies it by the divisor.

### Division Process

The division process is ruled by a two state FSM. The initial state first tests for special cases where either the dividend or divisor are zero, or if the are equal, or if the divisor is 1 or if the divisor is bigger than the dividend. These special cases bypass the iterative method and are handle in a single clock. When the standard division needs to be computed this state loads the lookup table's value to multiply the input factors. 

The second state checks if the divisor has converged towards one. When it does converge it checks if the remainder needs to be calculated if not then the acknowledge signal is asserted and returns to the initial state.

### Optimizations

The following describes design decisions used to optimized the design. These improve resource consumption and timing at the cost of results' precision.

#### 1's Complement vs 2's Complement

In the case of computing $2-d[i-1]$ let us consider the diference between the 2's and 1's complement. The 1's complement of a binary number is the invertion of each bit of the vector that repesents the number. On the other hand the 2's complement operation used to obtain the negative version of a number represented in binary form is the inversion of each bit followed by adding 1. Hence;

$$2 - d[i-1] \equiv 2 + ( invert(d[i-1]) + 1)$$

But as the bit resolution increases the effect less meaningful the contribution of the least significant bit in the magnitud of a binary represented number. Here is a demonstration.

|      Base      |          Binary Form          | Decimal Aproximation |
| :------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------: |
|      0.3       | 0000.0100_1100_1100_1100_1101 |     0.3000001907     |
| 2's complement | 1111.1011_0011_0011_0011_0011 |    -0.3000001907     |
| 1's complement | 1111.1011_0011_0011_0011_0010 |    -0.3000011444     |

Taking the previous into consideration we can lower the computational complexity by skipping the addition of 1 after the invertion. For our purposes this is an acceptable rounding error, specially when taking into account that the larger the vector the less significant is the error and the more the plus can cost to implement. This is the resulting approximation implemented in the design:

$$2 - d[i-1] \approxeq 2 + invert(d[i-1])$$

_NOTE: Given rounding errors this 1's complements approach will sometimes yield results that are more accurate than the actual 2's complement approach._ 

#### Function Generated Look Up Table 

To make this module reusable for input vectors of different sizes the lookup table that contains the fracional decimal numbers used to adjust the inputs is generated at compile time. The algorithm is simple; 0.1 repsented in binary form is represented by 0x0.199999... Where the first nibble after the fractional point is 0x1 and all other nibbles are 0x9. Therefore a concantation creates a vector of length `P_GDIV_FACTORS_MSB`+1 formed by {0x1, ((length/4)-1)*{0x9}}. This vector serves as the seed to create all other values in the table which are created by iterating a division by 10 until the last value larger than 0 is reached.

## Configurable Parameters

These are the compile time over-writable parameters.

When the division concludes the o_master_div_write_stb is asserted and writes the result to the address received through `o_wb4s_data`.
