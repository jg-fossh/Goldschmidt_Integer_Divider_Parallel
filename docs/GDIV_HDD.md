## Design

The Goldschmidt division is a fast division method. This division is a iterative process governed by the following equations:

$$d(i) = d[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$
$$D(i) = D[i-1].(2-d[i-1])$$ 

were $d$ is the divisor; $D$ is the dividend; $i$ is the step. $D$ converges toward the quotient and $d$ converges toward 1 at a quadratic rate. For the divisor to converge to 1 it must be less than 2 therefore integers greater than 2 must be multiplied by 10 to the negative powers to shift the decimal point.

Consider the following example: 
$\dfrac{16}{4}$

|  Step  | D                | d                 | 2-d              |

The code implementation compares the size of the divisor against 2 âˆ— 10^_n_ were _n_ is a natural number. The result of the comparison indicates the _m_ of 10^_m_, were _m_ is a negative integer, to multiply the divisor. Then the Goldschmidt division is performed until the divisor converges to degree indicated by `P GDIV ACCURACY`. The quotient returned is the rounded up value to which the dividend converged to. Each Goldschmidt step is performed in to two half steps in order use only half the multipliers and save resources. 

The remainder calculation requires an extra clock cycle. The calculation simply takes the value after the decimal point of the quotient a multiplies it by the divisor.

#### Optimizations

The following describes design decisions used to optimized the design. These improve resource consumption and timing at the cost of results' precision.

##### 1's Complement vs 2's Complement

There are two reasons the 2's complement is relevant for this divider. One is the 2-$d$ operation in the iterative equation.

##### Dropping Result MSBs

## Interfaces

The divider and divisor are received through `i_wb4s_data[P_GDIV_FACTORS_MSB:0]` and `i_wb4s_data[(P_GDIV_FACTORS_MSB*2)+1:P_GDIV_FACTORS_MSB+1]` and qualified by the `i_wb4s_stb`.

When the division concludes the o_master_div_write_stb is asserted and writes the result to the address received through `o_wb4s_data`.
